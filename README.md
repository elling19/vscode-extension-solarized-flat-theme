# Solarized Flat Theme for VS Code

Solarized Flat Theme is a pair of light and dark color themes for Visual Studio Code, inspired by the classic Solarized palette and designed with a modern, flat aesthetic. This extension provides a clean, distraction-free look while preserving the original Solarized color harmony and contrast.

## Features

- Two themes included: **Solarized Flat Light** and **Solarized Flat Dark**
- Faithful to the [Solarized palette](#color-palette), with solid fills and minimal gradients
- Carefully tuned for readability and a modern flat UI
- No build steps or scripts—purely declarative theme files
