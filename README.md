# Solarized Flat Theme for VS Code

Solarized Flat Theme is a pair of light and dark color themes for Visual Studio Code, inspired by the classic Solarized palette and designed with a modern, flat aesthetic. This extension provides a clean, distraction-free look while preserving the original Solarized color harmony and contrast.

## Features

- Two themes included: **Solarized Flat Light** and **Solarized Flat Dark**
- Faithful to the [Solarized palette](#color-palette), with solid fills and minimal gradients
- Carefully tuned for readability and a modern flat UI
- No build steps or scripts—purely declarative theme files

## Installation

1. Open the Extensions view in VS Code (`Ctrl+Shift+X`).
2. Search for `Solarized Flat Theme`.
3. Click **Install**.
4. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`), type `Color Theme`, and select either **Solarized Flat Light** or **Solarized Flat Dark**.

Alternatively, you can install from source:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/elling19/vscode-extension-solarized-flat-theme.git
cd vscode-extension-solarized-flat-theme
code .
```
Then press `F5` to launch an Extension Development Host and preview the themes.

## Color Palette

This theme uses the canonical Solarized palette:

```text
